# Overview

Lucky is a framework for writing [Juju] charms. It is being designed specifically to support writing Docker-powered charms easily, but its use is not limited to Docker. We want Lucky to be as easy to use as possible and be very well documented. We will focus on putting the developer's experience first, starting small and adding features as they become necessary or useful.

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started guide](./getting-started.md) to learn how to write your first Lucky charm. The guide will walk you through creating a charm for [CodiMD](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd).

## Development

Lucky is currently in Alpha. There are likely bugs and the documentation is still a work-in-progress, but you should still be able to use it to make charms.

## Bugs, Features, and Questions

If you have any bug reports or feature requests you can create a [Taiga issue][taiga_issue] and we'll see what we can do to help.

For questions or general discussion there is also a [Lucky category][category] on the [Juju forum][juju_forum].
