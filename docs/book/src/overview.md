# Overview

{toolname} is a work-in-progress framwork for writing [Juju] charms. It is being designed specifically to support writing Docker-powered charms easily. In the future the framework could be useful for more than Docker charms, but development is currently focused on providing facilities to run and configure Docker containers.

We want {toolname} to as easy to use as possible and be very well documented. We will focus on putting the developer's experience first, starting small and adding features as they become necessary or useful.

## Development

We are very early in development. In fact, we haven't started writing any code yet! We are currently working on this documentation and on outlining the [design](./design.md) plan before we start work on coding a proof-of-concept. If you have any questions or thoughts don't hesitate to open an issue.
