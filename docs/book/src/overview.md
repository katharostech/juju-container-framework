# Overview

Lucky is a framework for writing [Juju] charms. It is being designed specifically to support writing Docker-powered charms easily, but its use is not limited to Docker. We want Lucky to be as easy to use as possible and be very well documented. We will focus on putting the developer's experience first, starting small and adding features as they become necessary or useful.

## Developer Experience

The Lucky framework will provide a CLI that will be used to create and build Lucky charms. We will be focusing on making it easy to write charms in bash or any other shell language, but, through the Lucky commandline interface, any programming language could be used.

## Development

Lucky is currently in Alpha. There are likely bugs and the documentation is still a work-in-progress, but you should still be able to use it to make charms. Soon we will have a getting started guide that shows you how to make a full charm with Lucky. For now the CLI documentation is available on this site.

## Bugs, Features, and Questions

If you have any bug reports or feature requests you can create a [Taiga issue][taiga_issue] and we'll see what we can do to help.

For questions or general discussion there is also a [Lucky category][category] on the [Juju forum][juju_forum].
