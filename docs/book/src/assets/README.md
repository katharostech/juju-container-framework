# Assets

This directory contains images and other assets used in the docs.

## Diagrams

Most, if not all, of the diagrams in the documentation will have been made with [draw.io]. While the images are saved as PNG's in the repository by using Draw.io's export PNG feature, Draw.io includes all of the metadata necessary to open the exported PNG back into Draw.io to make changes.

In this way it is not necessary to separately store the PNG and the XML versions of the Draw.io diagrams.
