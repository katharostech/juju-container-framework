Build charm with the local copy of lucky embedded. This means that the charm will not attempt to download lucky when it starts and that the charm will only run on the platform and architecture that the charm was built with. This is mostly useful during development and only works on Linux builds made with the "daemon" feature.

If this is not specified, an automated build of lucky for the architecture that the charm is deployed to will be automatically downloaded when the charm is installed.
