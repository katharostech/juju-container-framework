Welcome to the Lucky CLI. Lucky is a framework for creating Juju charms. The Lucky framework is designed to make it [38;5;13m[3m[4m[1measy[0m and [38;5;13m[3m[4m[1mfun[0m to write
 charms that are powered by Docker containers.

[38;5;11m[4mThe Bighelp Pages[0m

Most of the commands in the Lucky CLI have an extra "bighelp" page, like this one, that can be accessed with the [48;5;236m--bighelp[0m or [48;5;236m-H[0m flag. We
 will strive to make these built-in docs to be enough to learn to use Lucky all by themselves.

[38;5;244m[1m‚ñê[0m [38;5;13m[1mTip:[0m On Unix systems or with Windows Git bash, it can be useful to pipe these docs to [48;5;236mless[0m to provide a pager. You can do so like this:
[38;5;244m[1m‚ñê[0m 
[38;5;244m[1m‚ñê[0m $ lucky -H | less -R
[38;5;244m[1m‚ñê[0m  
[38;5;244m[1m‚ñê[0m You can also add this to your [48;5;236m.bashrc[0m or other shell init file to automatically add the [48;5;236m-R[0m flag to all runs of [48;5;236mless[0m:
[38;5;244m[1m‚ñê[0m 
[38;5;244m[1m‚ñê[0m export LESS="-R"

[38;5;11m[4mGetting Started[0m

For charm development you will be most interested in the "charm" subcommand which can be used to build and create charms. The other
 commands are only used on the server, but their help messages can be useful during development.
