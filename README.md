# juju-container-framework ( JCF )

This is the home of a work-in-progress charm writing framework for [Juju]. The framwork will seek to provide a well-documented and easy-to-approach developer experience for writing charms that run Docker containers.

The original discussion that started this effort can be found [here][discussion] on the [Juju forums][forums].

The documentation site will be up soon.
